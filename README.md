# Smokerino

Hello everyone, 
after finishing my Master's in mechanical engineering I took the time to develop an Arduino based Smoker Controller (BBQ Arduino WiFi Pitmaster).
I am trying to make the projekt accessible to a lot more People who love BBQ as much as I do. 

Currently i have the first ever Prototype running. A lot more Testing needs to be done. I will try to make a Part list available as soon as possible.

Current Key Feature:
- Touch Screen 
- WiFi
- Blynk Access
- Automated Smoker startup
- Smoker PID Control
- PID Autotune
- 4 Meat Temperatures Simultaniously
