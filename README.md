# Smokerino

Hello everyone, 

after finishing my Master's in mechanical engineering I took the time to develop an Arduino based Smoker Controller (BBQ Arduino WiFi Pitmaster).
I am trying to make the projekt accessible to a lot more People who love BBQ as much as I do. 

Currently i have the first ever Prototype running. A lot more Testing needs to be done. I will try to make a Part list available as soon as possible.

Current [Features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnxOtorUJFU):
- Touch Screen 
- WiFi
- WiFi Autoreconnect
- Blynk Access
- Automated Smoker startup
- Smoker PID Control
- PID Autotune
- 4 Meat Temperatures Simultaniously (Up to 8 supported by the Hardware)
